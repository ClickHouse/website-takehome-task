### ClickHouse Design Engineer Take-home task

Welcome! You have been given a list of major cities. These cities are currently being parsed and shown in an unstyled table on the home page of this Nextjs app. You've been asked to rethink how this information is displayed and to make it more interactive.

Things we're looking for:
- Attractive and usable UI, it doesn't need to be a table
- New functionality (think search, filters, or sorting)
- Visual polish
- Clean and readable code

We've pre-installed Tailwind, but you can to use whatever tools you prefer. 

In summary, use this as an opportunity to show off your design and development skills in tandem, feel free to go wild but try to spend no more than 4 hours on this task.

--- 

To get started clone this repo. 
- Run `npm i` to install the dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to run locally

Once complete you can:
- Rename your clone and send us the address 
- Zip the directory and email it back to us or host it on a Cloud provider (Dropbox, Google Drive etc) and send us the link.  

Thanks!
