# ClickHouse Design Engineer Take-home task

**Welcome!** You’ve been provided with a list of major cities. These cities are currently being parsed and displayed in an unstyled table on the home page of this Next.js app. Your task is to rethink how this information is presented and make it more interactive.

## What we’re looking for:
- **Attractive and usable UI**: It doesn’t have to be a table.
- **New functionality**: Consider adding features like search, filters, or sorting.
- **Visual polish**: Make it look great!
- **Clean and readable code**: Maintain best practices.

We’ve pre-installed Tailwind, but feel free to use any tools you prefer.

## Summary
This as an opportunity to showcase your design and development skills together. Feel free to get creative, but aim to spend no more than **4 hours** on this task.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.  
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the app locally.  

## Submission Instructions
Once you’re done, you can:  
- Rename your cloned repository and share the link with us.  
- Zip the project directory and email it back.  
- Host it on a cloud provider (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive) and share the link.  

**Thank you!**
